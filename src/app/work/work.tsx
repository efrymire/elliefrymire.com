    description: <p>Early in 2022, I was struggling to find a city-run testing location in New York City. The <LinkWithArrow href='https://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/covid-19-testing-sites/'>city website</LinkWithArrow> included a list of addresses, but not a helpful interactive map. I took matters into my own hands and scraped the addresses and plotted them on a page using mapbox. This project even got some traction in <LinkWithArrow href="https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-has-more-100-mobile-covid-testing-sites-why-are-none-them-its-map">local news.</LinkWithArrow></p>,

    description: <p>
      In 2020, along with my colleague Aucher Serr, I built an interactive data visualization class curriculum from the ground up, inspired by our own masters and our work in the industry. 
      After our first class, we built a second, advanced studio course to follow. These courses have evolved over the years, but remain a critical component of <LinkWithArrow href="https://www.gc.cuny.edu/data-analysis-and-visualization">CUNY's Data Analysis and Visualization</LinkWithArrow> masters program.
      To learn more, you can check out the latest repository for the introduction course, or the projects from the latest iteration of the studio course (students are of course the sole owners of their work).

      I contributed directly with NBC graphics during the elections cycle, which resulted in a few <LinkWithArrow href="https://muckrack.com/ellie-frymire">bylines</LinkWithArrow>. 
      Some projects are not featured due to client restrictions, but I also worked on a financial services reporting tool, a marketing data exploration project, a map assisting food donations, and many more.

    description: <p>For my final thesis while pursuing my Masters in Data Visualization, I scraped nearly 1.4 million tweets from the public twitter search page to analyze the language within. Using kmeans cluster analysis, I find themes in the tweets and seek to answer the question: "what are people really saying about #metoo?" This thesis took me all over the world â€” I spoke about it at Antenna during Dutch Design Week, the Design Indaba Conference in Cape Town, as a lightning talk at Eyeo Festival in Minneapolis, and as a d3.js meet up talk.</p>,
